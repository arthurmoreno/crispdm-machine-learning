# CRISP-MD Machine Learning

## Project definition:

- Execute all the steps using Python Scripts
- Build a report about all the decisions taken in all steps of the project. Explain the choices made.
- Make experiments with K-NN, LVQ, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest and an heterogen "committee".
    - It will be necessary to make searches in the configuration committee.
    - Utilize the cross validation with stratified k-fold with k=10
    - Show the average accuracy and the standard deviation, confusion matrix, boxplot. Analyse the results with a classification report, present the tests that had most statistical significance.
- Extract a decision tree and identify which are the first attributes utilized on the decision tree building.
    - Propose suggestions of the decisions based on the found attributes. (?)
- Deliver the final report that has all the decisions and discussion about each step of the CRISP-DM.

## Libraries decision:

"Scikit-learnâ€™s true strength resides in its model assessment and selection architecture, which allows us to cross-validate and perform multiple hyperparameter searches on our models. Scikit-learn also helps us choose the best model for our work."

"The machine learning algorithm is also implemented using Scikit-learn, a higher-level library."

## Running the project:
